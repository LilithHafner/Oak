Turing Machine Synthesis based on a SAT solver

![Screenshot of unary single bit-shift being synthesized](Screenshots/View 1.png?raw=true)



**Status:** Usable work in progress. Capable of reasonably effective live Turing machine synthesis, but bug fixes and key features are still missing. Theory documents are a very rough draft and riddled with holes.



**Dependancies** that need to be installed manually are:

Python 3 (Tested on 3.8.2)

Tkinter and Tk

pillow (install with `$pip3 install pillow` or similar)

pycosat (install with `$pip3 install pycosat` or similar)



**Run** with `$cd Program`, and `$python3 main.py`, or execute main.py from IDLE
